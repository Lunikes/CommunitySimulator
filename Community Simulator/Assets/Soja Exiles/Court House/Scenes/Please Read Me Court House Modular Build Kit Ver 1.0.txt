Thank you so much for downloading the package, Court House Modular Build Kit Ver 1.0

I hope you enjoy the package.

The build kit is on a 2.5 Grid system.

It's recommended to use ProGrids by Unity from the asset store to assist in the building process, its free and lightweight.

If you like the package and would like to see an update that expands on the structures models, furniture, textures, props and layouts, please rate and review on the asset store.  Your feedback guides me on what to build and work on next.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please e-mail me at support@sojaexiles.com

Thanks
